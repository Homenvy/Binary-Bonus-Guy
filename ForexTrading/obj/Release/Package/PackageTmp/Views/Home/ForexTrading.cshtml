    <p>There is more information to consider when deciding to try out Forex trading. These can be formed into specific categories: Margin, Payouts and Losses, Closing a Position, Orders Types, Trade Size and Trading Costs. These fall into both Binary Options and Forexes.</p>
    <p><b>Margin</b> - Margins are available to use when trading Forex. Brokers determine the maximum margin with values that can be as high as 1:200 or 1:500. Investors using margins have their investment capital increased, resulting in a larger trade which comes out with a larger profit (as long as the trade is a winning one).</p>
    <p><b>Payouts / Losses</b> - Forex will never show the maximum proft that can be obtained in a trade. The investor has the option to set a limit or stop order. This ensures a certain percentage of profit will hit once the limit or stop order is performed. Losses can be managed this way as well. Be weary, however as the maximum loss could very well be all the money in the investor's account.</p>
    <p><b>Closing a Position</b> - The investor chooses when to end the position. As long as the market is open, when the investor chooses to end the position the broker has to execute the close.</p>
    <p><b>Order Types</b> - Forex provides many order types. Starting with the most popular: Buy/Sell orders. Following after are Limit, Stop, Trailing Stop and One Cancels the Other (OCO).</p>
    <ol style="margin-left: 5px;">
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Buy/Sell:</b> Also known as Market Order, this order type is executed immediately when placed. The price is determined by the current spot or market price. It immediately is set as an open position, subjecting the order to fluctuations in the market.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Limit:</b> This order type is designed to buy or sell a currency pair. This is only available when certain conditions are fulfilled, which are shown in the original trade. The order will sit at "pending order" and has no impact on the investor's account totals until the conditions are met.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Stop:</b> This order is a type of defensive measure an investor can use to help protect themselves from more losses. Stop orders will automatically close an open position when the exchange rate moves against the investor's will and reaches the set level. Stop orders can only restrict losses, not prevent them.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Trailing Stop:</b> This order type is very similar to a Stop order, however when the market moves in a favorable direction the trigger price moves in that direction. This limits the loss if the market direction changes.</li>
        <li><b>OCO (One Cancels the Other):</b> As the name suggests this order has two triggers: a limit and a stop. If one of these triggers is hit then the other is cancelled as the position is closed.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <p><b>Trade Size</b> - Brokers usually have full control on the trade size. Some allow the investors to trade in micro lots. These are usually a thousand units of the base currency in the Forex trade. Maximum amounts used in the trading is also set by each broker and have the potential to be as high as 100 standard lots or ten million in the base currency.</p>
    <p><b>Trading Costs</b> - In Forex trading the investor has to consider the spreads and rollover/swap values are. There is also commisions to take into consideration.</p>
