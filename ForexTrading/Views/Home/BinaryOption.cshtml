<div style="margin-left: 2px;">
    <p>There is more information to consider when deciding to try out Binary Options. These can be formed into specific categories: Margin, Payouts and Losses, Closing a Position, Orders Types, Trade Size and Trading Costs. These fall into both Binary Options and Forexes.</p>
    <p><b>Margin</b> - Margin is not really used when an investor is trading Binary Options. There are still possible large returns on an investment so many traders find Binary Options attractive. With Binary Options there is never a margin call.</p>
    <p><b>Payouts / Losses</b> - With Binary Options the investor will ALWAYS know the return percentage for any payout and loss. These payouts usually go up to 80% or even 400%. Each Binary Option is unique so each payout varies. Brokers will usually offer a loss back, which is defined as a return percentage on a losing Binary Options trade. There are brokers who do not have a loss back. Again, this will be information that can be picked up by the investor before even trading.</p>
    <p><b>Closing a Position</b> - Binary Options trading lets the investor decide when to stop the trade before the investment even begins. The time period could be 1 hour or even 1 week; the investor decides! When the time period expires, the trade will close automatically. There are early closure options offered by some brokers, but not all. There is also an option for a rollover. A Rollover occurs when the the expiration time hits, but the investor wishes to increase the expiration time. This will require the trader to also increase the original investment by a percentage. All percentages depend on the broker and are dynamic.</p>
    <p><b>Order Types</b> - 4 types of Binary Options exist for trade currently: High/Low, 60 Seconds Options, Boundary Options, and Touch/No Touch Options. There are other options available, but are uncommon and will not be listed here.</p>
    <ol style="margin-left: 5px;">
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>High/Low:</b> Also goes by the following names: Digital Option, UP/DOWN Option or most commonly CALL/PUT Option. Investors will determine if the Binary Option will increase or decrease in value over a time period. Once determined, there is a system that will monitor this investment and will notify the investor when the time period expires.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>60 Seconds Option:</b> As the name suggests, this type of Binary Option has a time period of 60 seconds. This method of trading is gaining popularity as trends in the market can show investors when a possible safe time to invest is present. Of course there is still a risk in the investment. Investors who respond quickly to changes in the market usually try these Binary Options.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Boundary Options:</b> This type of Binary Options trading can also be known as a Tunnel Option or a Range Option. There is a boundary range set with this option and the goal is to have the asset's value stay between the boundary. There are also options to have the asset's value go outside the boundary, but this is not as common. Some brokers may also allow the investor to collect a profit if the value breaks the boundary. Ultimately, the asset needs to stay between the limits of the boundary. Stable markets are usually ideal when dealing with this type of Binary Option.</li>
        <li><b>Touch/No Touch Options:</b> This Binary Option has a variety of options including Touch, No Touch or even Double Touch. Predefined rates are listed which are needed to win the trade. Investors predict that the value of an asset will reach a specific level (Touch) or the asset will not reach that level at all (No Touch). The level could be higher or lower than the asset's current value. This is a weekly trade option and investors purchase these options only on the weekend, when the markets are closed. The following week is when the trading begins. If the investor's level is reached during / after 17.00 GMT on the following Monday, it is considered a win and a profit is earned. If the investor has not reached the level by this time, he/she has all week for the asset to try to hit this level.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Trade Size</b> - The broker determines the maximum and minimum investment size for investors. These values can go anywhere from $5 per trade to $5,000 or more!</p>
    <p><b>Trading Costs</b> - Fortunately there are no spreads, commissions or even rollover/swap costs when choosing Binary Options.</p>
